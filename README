ogr2osm light

 python ogr2osm-l.py [filename]

 This is a stripped version of ogr2osm. It currently simply takes a filename and converts it to a .osm file containing nodes and ways

 Why this simplicity?
 Because it is almost impossible to maintain the complexity and validate stuff anywhere else then in one of the (pretty well maintained) OSM-editors
 The goal of this script is to create spaghetti that can be imported into one of the editors where it can be further processed and checked.
 Thanks to Iván Sánchez Ortega, 2009 <ivan@sanchezortega.es> for the initial stuff! Your beer will be waiting on the first time we meet.

 requirements: osgeo/ogr python bindings
